What the … ?
SmileyLibMaker is a java application which helps building emoticon librairies for various instant messanging applications.

Currently supported client/formats are:
**Adium (really working)** Kopete (should be working well, too)
**Gaim (still has issues because the smiley “keyword” can not contain spaces)** Miranda + SmileyAdd plugin (has issues because it would need to convert images to the .ico format)
**Miranda + ieview plugin (not sure it works at all?)**
